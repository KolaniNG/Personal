    <h1>About Me!</h1>
    <p>
      My name is Jo Guzman, but I go by the name KOLANI online.<br>
      I'm an artist, animator, voice actor and generally just a creative guy. <br><br>
      I've worked mainly in independent online animation and game projects. Here are some of the projects that I'm proud of working on! For examples of just my work, you can take a look around my website's <a href="art.html">art</a> and <a href="animation/html">animation</a> pages. :)<br><br>NOTE: For now, this will be the only page that mentions my voice and audio work.
    </p>

    <!--ANIMATION-->

    <h1>Animation Projects</h2>

      <p>Animation is my main passion. I've been animating for about 10 years, and through that time I've met a lot of amazing people and made a lot of good work. So far I've animated in Adobe Flash/Animate, Blender(grease pencil and some modeling), Toon Boom and Clip Studio Paint <br>Here's some of the most popular projects I've done!</p>
      <ul class="aboutList">
        <li><a href="https://www.newgrounds.com/portal/view/868509">Girls Night</a> - Served as a rough animator for a couple shots in a student film.</li>
        <li><a href="https://www.newgrounds.com/portal/view/846340">FulpWare</a> - Animated a short segment in this celebration of <a href="https://newgrounds.com/">Newgrounds.com</a></li>
        <li><a href="https://youtu.be/4V_aV0e6b6U?si=7Rjhr3-_4qNFJTKh">Pico And The Party Crashers</a> - Short action cartoon which was a collaboration between myself and LobsterMango primarily. I handled all the scenes where Pico (the kid with the orange hair) was fighting on his own. I also too care of the backgrounds. <br>I wrote, directed, storyboarded, animated (roughs and cleanup) and edited the sound for this cartoon.</li>
      </ul>

      <!--GAMES-->

      <h1>Games Projects</h1>

        <p>My experience in games so far is mainly just as an animator and graphic designer. Here's a couple projects I've had a hand in making!</p>
        <ul class="aboutList">
          <li><a href="https://www.newgrounds.com/portal/view/869136">POLY POLY POLY</a> - Puzzle game designed and programmed by my friend Dusky. I did graphic and character design, animation and I also drew all the abstract backgrounds used in the game.</li>
          <li><a href="https://www.newgrounds.com/portal/view/836289">Ruby Heart Matchmakers</a> - Match puzzle game made for a jam. Made some sprites, the logo, and wrote/created the main characters as well as the premise.</li>
        </ul>

    <!--AUDIO-->

    <h1>Audio/Voice Acting</h1>

      <p>My acting and audio editing experience came from making cartoons on my own since I was very young. I've learned a lot over the years! Here's a few projects I'm proud of making and/or being a part of.</p>
      <ul class="aboutList">
        <li><a href="https://www.newgrounds.com/audio/listen/1124770">Dastardly Deviants and Dizzy Detevtives</a> - A short audio drama about three thieves stealing an alien from a government facility because they want it to lead them to it's ship, only for things to go off the rails when they are found by two stupid cops. Action, a HINT of romance, drama, and some laughs. I wrote, directed, edited and played the part of Luciano in this.</li>
        <li><a href="https://www.newgrounds.com/audio/listen/1129368">Drowning In The Rain</a> - A mother suspects her son of a heinous act in this short thriller audio drama. I wrote, directed and edited this.</li>
        <li><a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt27073388/episodes/?season=4&ref_=tt_eps_sn_4">Disventure Camp Season 4 - Carnival of Chaos</a> - Disventure Camp heads to the carnival, where the eighteen newcomers are split into two teams that have to complete challenges each episode. Losing team has to vote someone off. It's animated reality TV! I play the role of Diego Olivo in the series. <br>Due to some complications with the previous actor, I had to step in and redub episodes that were already finished. So, for half of my time on the show I did ADR and the other half was prelay. <br><br></li>
