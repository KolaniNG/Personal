    <h2>Project PICO</h2>
    <p>[Log Date 2022-03-16] - I didn't plan on making anything for pico day this year, but I feel like the spark of inspiration I needed is there now and I might as well take it now. Plan so far:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Concept: Pico has to kill brackenwood.</li>
      <li>Need Outline</li>
      <li>Need Storyboards</li>
      <li>Need Sound</li>
      <li>Need to animate.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>looking to make this short, so let's see... <br><br>
    *Pico logs into his big ol computer with a crt monitor and opens up an IRC Chat.* <br>
    Pico: Yo, got any contracts for me? <br>
    Darnell: Yeah, but you're not gonna believe what I am looking at right now... This thing can MOVE... <br>
    Pico: Thing...? Darnell we're assasins, not exterminators. If they're paying us to kill animals or something you can tell em to- <br>
    D: 1.5 Million Dollas. <br>
    P: WHAT, NO WAY <br>
    D: I already said yes, and they paid us half in advance. We get the other half IF we kill it. <br>
    P: BADASS, what are we dealing with?? <br>
    D: See for yourself... <br>
    *clips of brackenwood flash by* <br>
    P: What the fuck...? <br>
    D: Good luck. <br>
    *cut to pico getting his sniper rifle from pico school ready*
    from here on out it's all action.</p>
