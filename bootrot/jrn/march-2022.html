  <h2>March 16th 2022</h2>
  <p>Made the BootRot subsection of the website for myself. An old aquaintance told me I should write more, even if it's just for myself.
  I feel like making this little place and putting it out there, even if it's in such a minimal way, might help me with that. I also think
  having a blog that only my friends (and people dedicated enough to look) would know about it.<br><br>As for how things are going for me,
  currently I'm practicing drawing in perspective since I've got a test for an animation school coming up. Been frantically practicing
  at every possible opportunity. Wish me luck. (* ￣︿￣)</p>
